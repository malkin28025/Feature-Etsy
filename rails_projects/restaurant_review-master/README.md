# Restaurant Review

Today's sample app is going to be a very scaled-down version of something like Yelp or Urbanspoon. There will be restaurants, and users, and users will leave reviews of restaurants.

Let's describe some things about this app.

Restaurant:
* stars (related to user review?)
* type of food
* service (related to user review?)
* price
* attire
* address
* phone
* name

Users:
* name
* email
  * can review/rate
